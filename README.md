# Organizr

Organizr is a Java and JavaFX desktop application that organizes files based on their type. With just a folder path, the app creates separate folders for file types like images, videos, documents, etc., and sorts everything automatically.

## ðŸ—‚ How It Works

1. User inputs the path of the folder to be sorted.
2. The application scans all files and detects their types.
3. It creates subfolders such as:
   - `/Images`
   - `/Videos`
   - `/Documents`
   - `/Audio`
   - `/Archives`
4. Each file is moved to its respective folder.
5. In Auto Mode, the app runs silently in the background and keeps sorting new files in real-time.

## ðŸ“‹ Note

1. Auto sorter mode runs in background even if you close the window. You can close it from Task manager, it will appear as "OpenJDK Platform binary" in Task manage, click on it and then click on "End task" to stop auto Sorter or it wil also terminate on shutdown.
